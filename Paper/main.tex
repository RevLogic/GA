\section*{Abstract}

his paper explores the use of genetic programming in conjunction with a shared cube representation of reversible cascades to minimize the gate count and quantum cost of arbitrary reversible circuits. Rather than optimizing for either quantum cost or cascade length, we utilize a feature vector approach to minimize both aspects. A recent approach by Nayeem and Rice provides a foundation for the shared-cube approach to reversible logic synthesis. Due to the complexity of these operations, we expand on this foundation, combining it with a genetic algorithm to yield a solution. This approach allows us to achieve a solution more quickly than by performing a brute-force search over the problem space.
We demonstrate the use of a shared cube representation from \cite{Nayeem2011} and apply an evolutionary algorithm to find optimized representations. We consider an implementation that uses a subset of the ordering rules in \cite{Rice2011} as a guideline for implementing our mutation function. We present an implementation of this approach and selected examples using the Python programming language, and compare our results to those achieved in the literature as applied to Revlib benchmarks \cite{RevLib}.
