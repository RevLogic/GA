\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a method to optimize reversible logic synthesis using genetic algorithms. Additionally, we have detailed the implementation of a reversible logic synthesis framework which allowed us to implement the genetic algorithm method to a large extent.

Our genetic algorithm shows promise, but it is by no means optimal: further investigation is required in order to ascertain its effectiveness due to discrepancies in quantum cost calculation between our framework and those presented in RevLib.

Future research in this area should address topics such as function-preserving mutation and crossover functions, as these were points of difficulty in our implementation.
