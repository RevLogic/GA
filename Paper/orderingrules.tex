\subsection{ESOP Cube List Ordering Rules}


Modifications to the above method %with the use of inverters instead of a negation line, careful ordering 
%of cubes to reduce the number of not gates and and sharing cubes between output lines 
have both reduced the number of lines and the number of gates required to implement these circuits. % see \emph{[To add citations for these papers]}.  
In \cite{Nayeem2011}, for example, a number of rules were proposed that manipulate the cube list representation to create a new cube list with 
the same output as the first one, 
depending on the rule and the state of the cube that the rule is being applied to these rules may increase 
or decrease the number of cubes in the list.\\
