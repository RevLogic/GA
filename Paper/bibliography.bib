	are discussed. The first method has an energy dissipation which is
	proportional to the square of the error in the voltage, while the
	second method has an energy dissipation which can in principle be
	reduced indefinitely by slowing the speed of computation. The first
	method is basically an extension to 'pass logic' which has been previously
	used with both nMOS (hot clock nMOS) and CMOS transmission gates
	to achieve low energy dissipation. The second method is a novel thermodynamically
	reversible logic system based on CCD-like operations which switches
	charge packets in a reversible fashion to achieve low energy dissipation.},
