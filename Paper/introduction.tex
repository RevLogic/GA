Reversible computing is a field that is rapidly gaining interest among researchers due to its potential to circumvent the fundamental limitations in energy efficiency and heat loss that are faced by traditional irreversible computing designs. It has been suggested that within 20 years, we will no longer be able to achieve further increases in performance or efficiency at a chip level using irreversible circuits (\cite{Frank2005}). It has also been long known that reversible logic can lead to circuits with much lower power dissipation (\cite{Landauer61}) and in theory, it is possible to design a reversible circuit capable of dissipating zero energy (\cite{Bennett73}). Interest in reversible logic is also growing because it has been shown to be applicable to other fields such as optical computing (\cite{Picton91}), low power CMOS design (\cite{Athas94}), nanotechnology (\cite{Merkle1993}), and quantum computing (\cite{AlRabadi2004}).
