\section{ESOP Cube-list Representations}

Any boolean function can be represented by an exclusive-or sum-of-products (ESOP) expression.This is
particularly useful for reversible logic synthesis since there are existing algorithms for converting 
any ESOP expression into a cascade of reversible toffoli gates, thus generating a reversible circuit 
to implement your original function. \\ 


In reversible circuit design ESOP expressions are often written as a cube-list. A cube list is an $ n \times m $
matrix with $m$, the number of product terms in the ESOP expression, and $n = i + j$ where $i$ is the number 
of input variables and $j$ is the number output variables. Each of the $m$ rows in the matrix are the individual
cubes that make up the cube list and represent one of the products from the ESOP expression. \\

Each cube in the list takes the general form: $x_{1} x_{2} ... x_{i} f_{1} f_{2} ... f_{j}$, where each of the elements $x_{1} .. x_{i}$ 
represent an input variables and each element $f_{1} .. f_{j}$ represents an output variable. For each cube in the 
cube list a $1$ is written in cube position $x_{k}$ , $k \in \{1,2, ..., i\}$ if the variable $x_{k}$ is in 
the ESOP product for that row, a $0$ is written if the negation $\bar{x}_{k}$ is present, and a '$-$' nis written if $x_{k}$ is not present in that
product term for that cube. For each element, $f_{p}$, $p \in {1,2,...j}$, a 1 is written if that output variable contains 
the product represented by the input portion of the list and a 0 otherwise. See figure \emph{draw figure 1} for 
an example. \\

Given an ESOP represented as a cube list in this way \emph{[To add citation: Fazel et al.]} proposed a 
method of reversible logic synthesis that implements the function as a reversible circuit using only 
Toffoli gates. In this method an empty cascade with $2i + j$ lines is created. Two input lines are given for every input 
variable where one line corresponds to the variable $x_{k}$, the $2^{nd}$ line corresponds to its negation, $\bar{x}_{k}$, 
and the remaining $j$ lines correspond to the output variables. For every output line $f_{p}$, a Toffoli gate 
is placed with its target on line $f_{p}$ and a control for that target is placed on the input line $x_{k}$ if there was a 1
in the cube for the corresponding variable, or on the negation line of $x_{k}$ if there was a 0 in the
cube for $x_{k}$, see figure (draw figure 2). This method allows a cube-list to be quickly and efficiently transformed 
into a reversible cascade and allows for the synthesis of rather large functions. \\*
